# Day 4 Reflection: GPU Acceleration and Performance Enhancement

## Today's Progress
- Modified the detector node to support GPU acceleration
- Added performance monitoring (FPS, confidence scores, class counts)
- Implemented frame output with detection visualizations
- Tested with YOLOv8s model on NVIDIA GTX 1650 GPU

## Key Learnings
1. **GPU vs CPU Performance**: The GPU provides significantly faster inference times
2. **Device Detection**: Learned to programmatically detect and use available hardware
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implemented comprehensive logging of detection metrics
4. **Output Management**: Added functionality to save processed frames for analysis

## Code Changes
- Added Torch import and device detection logic
- Modified model loading to support GPU transfer
- Added performance logging function
- Implemented frame saving with timestamp-based filenames

## Results
- GPU acceleration improved inference speed by ~330% compared to CPU
- Performance logging provides valuable metrics for system optimization
- Output frames enable visual verification of detection quality

## Next Steps
- Implement multi-object tracking
- Add sensor fusion with simulated radar data
- Create performance comparison between different YOLO models
