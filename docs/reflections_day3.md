# Day 3 Reflection: YOLOv8 Object Detection Integration

## What I Learned
- Integrated a state-of-the-art object detection model (YOLOv8) into ROS 2
- Converted between ROS messages and OpenCV images for processing
- Worked with the KITTI dataset, a standard in autonomous driving research
- Created a detector node that publishes detection results as standard ROS messages

## Challenges Faced
- NumPy version compatibility issues between ROS 2 and Ultralytics
- Understanding the YOLOv8 output format and converting to ROS messages
- Handling multiple camera input sources (video files and image sequences)

## Key Takeaways
- Pre-trained models can provide powerful capabilities with minimal code
- Standard message types (like vision_msgs) make systems interoperable
- Real-world datasets like KITTI provide much better results than synthetic data
- The importance of timing and synchronization in perception systems
