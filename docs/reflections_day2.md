# Day 2 Reflection: ROS 2 Core Concepts

## What I Learned
- Established a ROS 2 communication pipeline between nodes
- Created a camera publisher that can handle both video files and image sequences
- Built a display subscriber for visualizing the video feed
- Understood the importance of proper error handling and resource management

## Challenges Faced
- Initially had issues with webcam access in WSL2
- Learned to adapt by using video files instead
- Worked through NumPy compatibility issues with ROS 2 packages

## Key Takeaways
- ROS 2's publish-subscribe model is powerful for building modular systems
- Proper project structure from the beginning saves time later
- Simulation is crucial when hardware access is limited
