# Day 1 Reflection: Environment Setup & Core Concepts

## What Went Well
- Successfully set up a hybrid Win11/WSL2/Ubuntu development environment
- Installed and configured ROS 2 Jazzy for future integration
- Built a working camera sensor simulator with OpenCV
- Implemented realistic ECU logging with CAN message simulation
- Established a professional Git repository structure

## Challenges Overcome
- Resolved the Ubuntu 24.04 "externally-managed-environment" Python issue using venv
- Learned to properly structure a Python project for automotive applications
- Understood the difference between simple scripting and professional simulation

## Key Insights
- Automotive software requires thinking about data flow between components
- Documentation is crucial for explaining system architecture
- Simple simulations can demonstrate complex automotive concepts effectively

## Questions for Further Exploration
- How are CAN messages structured at the byte level?
- How would this simulation integrate with a real-time system like ROS 2?
- What other sensor types (LiDAR, radar) should be added to this simulation?
